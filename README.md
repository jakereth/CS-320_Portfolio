When ensuring that my code, program, and software are both functional and secure it requires a mix of careful design, thorough testing, and keeping best practices in mind while writing code. Writing and running tests helped me with catching potential issues before they became larger more time consuming problems later on in the assignment. Some of the techniques such as input validation, error handling, and authentication also helped with prevent vulnerabilities that could result in failures with the program. It was very important that I utilized Continuous Integration to ensure that every code change I made I tested thoroughly, making the overall process smoother and ensuring that it ran reliably. By maintaining proper documentation it helped me whenever I had to go back and make a revision.

When designing software I always start with reading the requirements multiple times and taking notes to highlight my essential function and which order I need to work in. This means breaking down features into smaller, manageable tasks and implementing Test-Driven Developmen to validate functionality as I code. An iterative approach allows for adjustments based on feedback whcih when provided by my professor I was easily able to go back and correct what I needed to. Designing software with modularity in my mind helps to ensure scalability. Automated testing plays a crucial role in this process by consistently validating new changes, helping to maintain high-quality standards without relying solely on manual testing. By integrating these strategies, I can create software that is both efficient and adaptable to evolving requirements.
